whisper
=======

A toy micro-blog built on top of Node.js & Postgres.

Don't take it too seriously because I sure don't.

If you choose to use it and put it in production, remember to change the
``SECRET_PASSWORD`` variable in ``whisper.js`` to something new and secret.

License is BSD.

Requirements
============

* node.js v0.1.102+ (http://github.com/ry/node)
* Postgres v8.4+
* The ``postgres`` adapter for node (easiest to install via npm)
* The ``mustache.js`` library - http://github.com/janl/mustache.js.git
